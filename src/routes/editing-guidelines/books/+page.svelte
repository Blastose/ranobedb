			<h2>What can be added</h2>
			<p>
				Only Japanese books or books that are considered light novels and have a Japanese release
				can be added to the database.
				<br />
				Exceptions: Japanese web novels that are translated to English and published as a book can be
				included.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Titles</h2>
			<p>
				A title for each language can be added to a book. Use only official titles from the
				publisher; do not use fan translated titles. Some books contain an English title; do not use
				these are they often have poor English; you can add those to the aliases field in series
				instead.
				<br />
				Romanize the title if it needs to be romanized, and leave the field blank if it doesn't.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>
				A short description of the book. Use descriptions provided by the English publisher if
				available. Otherwise, translations of the Japanese description are also allowed.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Description (Japanese)</h2>
			<p>
				A short description of the book in Japanese. Use descriptions provided by the Japanese
				publisher.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Language</h2>
			<p>
				Lanuage that the book was originally written in. You should only add books that were
				originally written in Japanese, so this field should always be Japanese.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Release date</h2>
			<p>
				The date the book was originally released.
				<br />
				This field may be removed in the future, since we may be able to get the release date from the
				book's releases instead.
