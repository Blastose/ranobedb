## Contributing

### Prerequisites

RanobeDB is written in SvelteKit and TypeScript and the database uses [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). You will need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo or fork it on Github and then clone your own repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Blastose/ranobedb.git
```

or

```sh
git clone https://github.com/{YOUR_ACCOUNT_HERE}/ranobedb.git
```

2. Install npm packages with pnpm

```sh
pnpm install
```

3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill it out. If you are only running the site locally, you can skip filling out the `MAILGUN_DOMAIN` and `MAILGUN_API_KEY` fields

4. Create a PostgreSQL database with the same name as the one you put in the `DATABASE_URL` env variable, then run the database migration script

```sh
npx kysely migrate:latest
```

5. Seed the database (optional)

   - Add test users from `sql/test_users.sql` or
   - Populate the database with the test database dump `db-seed.dump`
   - Run the database migration script again

6. Start the development server

```sh
pnpm run dev
```
